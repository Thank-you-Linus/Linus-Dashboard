# 🤖 AI-Driven Development Workflow

> **Inspired by Riven Dev Method**  
> **Goal**: Code 2-5× faster with stable, maintainable code

## 🎯 What is This?

This `.aidriven/` directory contains the **AI memory system** for the Linus Dashboard project. It enables systematic AI-assisted development by separating:

1. **Memory** (`memorybank.md`) - Project architecture and decisions
2. **Rules** (`rules/*.md`) - Coding standards and patterns
3. **Prompts** (`prompts/*.md`) - AI interaction workflows
4. **Templates** (`templates/*.md`) - Structured outputs

## 🔄 Workflow

### Two-Phase Development

#### Phase 1: 🧠 Planning (Thinking Mode)
**Model:** Claude Opus 4.1 (Deep reasoning)

**Process:**
1. Load context from `memorybank.md` + `rules/*.md`
2. Analyze requirements
3. Design architecture
4. Break down into tasks
5. Generate detailed plan using `templates/plan_template.md`
6. **WAIT FOR USER APPROVAL** ✋

**Example:**
```
You: "Add TypeScript support for custom embedded card types"

AI: [Loads .aidriven/ context]
    [Creates detailed plan with:]
    - 6 specific tasks
    - Code examples for each
    - Type definitions
    - Testing approach
    - Estimated 4 hours
    
    "Please review this plan before I implement"
```

#### Phase 2: ⚙️ Implementation (Execution Mode)
**Model:** Claude Sonnet (Fast execution)

**Process:**
1. Follow approved plan step-by-step
2. Apply ALL rules from `rules/*.md`
3. Write clean, typed, documented code
4. Build and test
5. Validate against plan
6. Loop until complete

**Example:**
```
You: "Approved, proceed with implementation"

AI: [Implements Task 1]
    ✅ Created types/custom-cards.ts
    ✅ Added TypeScript definitions
    ✅ Type check passes
    
    [Implements Task 2]
    ✅ Modified embedLovelace.ts
    ✅ Added card type validation
    
    ... continues until done
```

## 🚀 How to Use

### For New Features

```bash
# 1. Ask AI to plan (with context loading)
"Claude, load .aidriven/ context and create a plan for: [feature description]"

# AI loads memorybank.md + rules, generates plan

# 2. Review and approve plan
"Looks good, proceed" or "Change X, then proceed"

# 3. AI implements following the plan
# AI automatically checks each step against rules

# 4. Build and test
npm run build
./ha-env/bin/hass -c /config

# 5. Review before commit
"Claude, use review.md to review these changes"
```

### For Debugging

```bash
# AI uses debug.md workflow
"Claude, use .aidriven/prompts/debug.md to investigate this error: [error message]"

# AI:
# 1. Loads context
# 2. Analyzes root cause (frontend vs backend)
# 3. Provides fix with explanation
# 4. Suggests rule update to prevent recurrence
```

### For Code Review

```bash
# Before committing
"Claude, review my changes using .aidriven/prompts/review.md"

# AI checks:
# - Code quality (TypeScript and Python)
# - Rule compliance
# - Type safety
# - Performance
# - Testing
# - Build verification
```

## 🎯 Objective
Create a new aggregate view that shows all vacuum entities grouped by room/area

## 📝 Tasks

### Task 1: Create VacuumView Class
**Files to Create:**
- src/views/VacuumView.ts

**Code:**
```typescript
import { AbstractView } from "./AbstractView";
import { VacuumCard } from "../cards/VacuumCard";

export class VacuumView extends AbstractView {
  getCards(): LovelaceCardConfig[] {
    const vacuums = Helper.getEntities().filter(e => e.domain === "vacuum");

- src/variables.ts

[... detailed plan continues ...]

**Estimated:** 3 hours across 5 tasks
```

**After Approval:**
AI implements each task, following all rules, builds, and tests.

### Example 2: Debugging Cache Issue

**Request:**
> "Users report 'red error' after updating to v1.3.0"

**AI Debug Response:**
```markdown
## 🐛 Debug Analysis

### Root Cause
Browser is loading old JavaScript bundle from cache. The cache-busting version parameter may not be applied correctly.

### Investigation Steps
1. Check `__init__.py` → `register_static_paths_and_resources()`
2. Verify version is read from `manifest.json` via `get_version()`
3. Confirm versioned_url is constructed: `f"{js_url}?v={manifest_version}"`
4. Check resource registration logs

### Fix
Ensure `get_version()` correctly reads from manifest and returns version string:

```python
def get_version() -> str:
    """Get the version from manifest.json."""
    manifest_path = Path(__file__).parent / "manifest.json"
    try:
        with manifest_path.open(encoding="utf-8") as manifest_file:
            manifest = json.load(manifest_file)
            return manifest.get("version", "unknown")
    except (FileNotFoundError, json.JSONDecodeError, KeyError):
        _LOGGER.exception("Failed to read version from manifest")
        return "unknown"
```

### User Instructions
Add to documentation:
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Check version query parameter in DevTools → Network tab

### Prevention
Update `testing_documentation.md` to include cache-clearing in testing checklist.
```

```

#### Documentation Quality Checklist

Before considering a bug fix or feature complete:

- [ ] **Code has documentation** - JSDoc/docstrings for all public methods
- [ ] **Type hints present** - All parameters and returns typed
- [ ] **User docs updated** - README reflects change
- [ ] **Memory bank updated** - Architecture section reflects reality
- [ ] **Rules updated** - Patterns added to prevent similar issues
- [ ] **Build succeeds** - `npm run build` passes without errors
- [ ] **Type check passes** - `npm run type-check` succeeds
- [ ] **Lint passes** - `npm run lint` succeeds (MUST fix errors before commit)
- [ ] **Manual test** - Feature/fix verified in running HA instance

#### 🚨 CRITICAL: Linting Before Commit

**MANDATORY RULE:** You MUST run `npm run lint` before EVERY commit.

**Why This Matters:**
- ❌ Committing without linting introduces code quality issues
- ❌ Linting errors can break CI/CD pipelines
- ❌ Code style inconsistencies accumulate over time
- ❌ Type safety issues may be missed

**Process:**
```bash
# 1. ALWAYS run lint before staging files
npm run lint

# 2. If there are ERRORS (not just warnings), you MUST fix them
# Do NOT commit with linting errors

# 3. If lint fixes files automatically (--fix flag), review the changes
git diff

# 4. Only commit after lint succeeds (0 errors)
git add .
git commit -m "your message"
```

**Example - Correct Workflow:**
```bash
# Write code
vim src/linus-strategy.ts

# Run lint FIRST
npm run lint
# Output: ✖ 1 problem (1 error, 0 warnings)

# Fix the error
# Re-run lint
npm run lint
# Output: ✖ 0 problems (0 errors, 31 warnings)  ← Warnings are OK

# NOW you can commit
git add src/linus-strategy.ts
git commit -m "feat: implement smart version management"
```

**Warnings vs Errors:**
- **Errors (red ✖)**: MUST be fixed before commit
- **Warnings (yellow ⚠)**: Should be addressed but won't block commit

**AI Agent Rule:**
When an AI agent (like me) is about to commit code:
1. I MUST run `npm run lint` first
2. I MUST fix any errors (not just warnings)
3. I MUST verify 0 errors before proceeding with commit
4. I MUST NOT commit code that fails linting

#### Why This Matters

**Problem:** Code changes without documentation updates lead to:
- ❌ AI agents making same mistakes repeatedly
- ❌ Users unable to understand features
- ❌ Team confusion about architecture
- ❌ Memory bank becoming outdated
- ❌ Rules not preventing known issues
- ❌ Build issues not caught early

**Solution:** Systematic documentation updates ensure:
- ✅ AI agents learn from fixes
- ✅ Users have accurate information
- ✅ Team stays aligned
- ✅ Memory bank stays current
- ✅ Rules prevent regression
- ✅ Build quality maintained

## 🎓 Best Practices

### 1. Always Load Context

❌ **Bad:**
```
"Add a new card type"
```

✅ **Good:**
```
"Claude, load .aidriven/memorybank.md and rules, then create a plan to add a new card type for displaying battery status with percentage and state"
```

### 2. Plan Before Building

❌ **Bad:**
```
"Build custom chip support" → Immediate coding without plan
```

✅ **Good:**
```
"Create a plan for custom chip support" → Review → "Approved" → Implementation
```

### 3. Follow the Plan

❌ **Bad:**
Deviating from approved plan without documenting

✅ **Good:**
Following plan exactly, noting any necessary deviations with rationale

### 4. Update Memory

❌ **Bad:**
Implementing feature, forgetting to update memorybank.md

✅ **Good:**
Update memorybank.md when architecture changes, document decisions

### 5. Review Before Commit

❌ **Bad:**
Committing without linting, AI review, or manual testing

✅ **Good:**
```bash
npm run lint          # MANDATORY - Fix all errors
npm run type-check    # Verify types
npm run build         # Ensure build works
# Manual test in HA
# Then: "Claude, review these changes using review.md"
git commit
```

### 6. Build and Test

❌ **Bad:**
Committing TypeScript changes without linting and building

✅ **Good:**
```bash
npm run lint          # FIRST - Fix all errors before proceeding
npm run type-check    # Verify types
npm run build         # Build the project
./ha-env/bin/hass -c /config
# Test in browser, clear cache
```

---
