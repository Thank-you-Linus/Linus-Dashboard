# Linus Dashboard — Claude Context

**Linus Dashboard** is a custom Home Assistant Lovelace dashboard strategy — auto-generated dashboard
UI with 28+ card types and 9 view types. TypeScript/React frontend (Rspack), Python 3.13 custom
component backend. Target HA 2025.5.0+.

## Non-negotiable rules

- **No 'v' prefix in git tags** (e.g. `1.4.1`, never `v1.4.1`) — breaks the release pipeline.
- **All 6 quality gates must pass before merge**: ESLint, type-check, unit tests (Vitest), 15/15 smoke
  tests, production build, coverage maintained or improved. Run via `/sapiens/quality-check` or
  `npm run lint && npm run type-check && npm run test && npm run build`.
- Must stay compatible with HA 2025.5.0+ — follow the Lovelace card API, don't break WebSocket message
  types.
- Naming: PascalCase components/classes, camelCase functions/variables (Python: snake_case), private
  members prefixed `_`.

## Sapiens toolchain note

This repo's `.sapiens/` (filesystem backend) coexists with a separate `.aidriven/` toolchain
(`elaborate-plan`/`new-track`) — `.sapiens:value-analysis`/`create-epic` were historically absent here
until `/sapiens:init` populated `.sapiens/context` and `.sapiens/rules` (now done). `.aidriven/AGENTS.md`
remains the source for build/lint/test commands and local HA dev environment setup.

# RTK (Rust Token Killer) - Token-Optimized Commands

## Golden Rule

**Always prefix commands with `rtk`**. If RTK has a dedicated filter, it uses it. If not, it passes through unchanged. This means RTK is always safe to use.

**Important**: Even in command chains with `&&`, use `rtk`:
```bash
# ❌ Wrong
git add . && git commit -m "msg" && git push

# ✅ Correct
rtk git add . && rtk git commit -m "msg" && rtk git push
```

## RTK Commands by Workflow

### Build & Compile (80-90% savings)
```bash
rtk cargo build         # Cargo build output
rtk cargo check         # Cargo check output
rtk cargo clippy        # Clippy warnings grouped by file (80%)
rtk tsc                 # TypeScript errors grouped by file/code (83%)
rtk lint                # ESLint/Biome violations grouped (84%)
rtk prettier --check    # Files needing format only (70%)
rtk next build          # Next.js build with route metrics (87%)
```

### Test (60-99% savings)
```bash
