## 🎯 What is Linus Brain?

Linus Brain acts as an **AI bridge** between your Home Assistant and a cloud-based learning system (Supabase). It:

1. **Collects** movement-related signals from your home (motion, occupancy, media activity, lighting)
2. **Aggregates** this data by room with a computed movement score
3. **Sends** the data to Supabase for AI analysis
4. **Receives** automation rules generated by AI based on learned patterns
5. **Applies** these rules to create smart automations in your Home Assistant

## 📊 Data Format

### Presence Data Sent to Supabase

```json
{
  "room": "salon",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-22T21:32:12Z",
  "entities": {
    "motion": "on",
    "movement": "off",
    "occupancy": "off",
    "media": "playing",
    "luminosity": 24.5
  },
  "movement_score": 0.75
}
```

### Presence Score Calculation

The movement score is a weighted sum (0-1) of:
- **Motion sensors**: 40% weight
- **Presence sensors**: 30% weight
- **Occupancy sensors**: 30% weight
- **Media players**: 25% weight
- **Luminosity**: 5% weight (inverted for evening movement)

### Light Action Data (Activity-Based Learning)

```json
{
  "instance_id": "uuid-of-ha-instance",
  "entity_id": "light.kitchen",
  "area": "kitchen",
  "action_type": "brightness",
  "activity": "occupied",
  "activity_duration": 127.3,
  "state": {
    "brightness": 204,
    "color_temp": 370
  },
  "context": {
    "movement_detected": true,
    "illuminance": 12.3,
    "sun_elevation": -8.5,
    "hour": 19,
    "day_of_week": 4
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-10-22T19:15:00Z"
}
```

**Action Types:**
- `turn_on` - Light was turned on
- `turn_off` - Light was turned off  
- `brightness` - Brightness was adjusted
- `color_temp` - Color temperature was changed
- `color` - RGB or HS color was changed

**Activity Levels:**
- `empty` - No movement detected in the area
- `movement` - Presence detected for less than 60 seconds
- `occupied` - Continuous movement for 60 seconds or more

**Activity Transitions:**
Activity levels automatically transition based on sensor states:
- Sensors activate → `empty` → `movement` (instant)
- Sensors stay active 60s → `movement` → `occupied` (after threshold)
- All sensors deactivate → `occupied/movement` → `empty` (instant)

These transitions can trigger automation rules, allowing different actions based on activity level. For example:
- `movement` detected + area is dark → Turn on lights at 50% brightness
- `occupied` detected + area is dark → Increase brightness to 80%
- Transition to `empty` → Turn off lights after delay

**Manual Detection:**
- Only captures actions with `user_id` in Home Assistant context
- Automatically filters out automations, scripts, and service calls
- Ensures learning is based on actual user preferences in real activity contexts

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Prerequisites

1. **Supabase Project**: Create a free project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. **Database Setup**: Run the complete schema from `scripts/../../scripts/supabase_setup.sql` in the repository, or create the required tables:

#### `ha_instances` table (Multi-instance support)

```sql
CREATE TABLE ha_instances (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    instance_name TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### `movement_data` table

```sql
CREATE TABLE movement_data (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    instance_id UUID REFERENCES ha_instances(id),
    room_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    room_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    movement_score NUMERIC(5,2) NOT NULL,
    motion_detected BOOLEAN,
    movement_detected BOOLEAN,
    occupancy_detected BOOLEAN,
    media_playing BOOLEAN,
    illuminance NUMERIC(10,2),
    entity_states JSONB,
    timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_movement_instance_room_time ON movement_data(instance_id, room_id, timestamp DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_movement_score ON movement_data(movement_score);
```

#### `light_actions` table (Activity-based light learning)

```sql
CREATE TABLE light_actions (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    instance_id UUID REFERENCES ha_instances(id),
    entity_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    area TEXT,
    action_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    activity TEXT NOT NULL,
    activity_duration NUMERIC(10,1),
    state JSONB NOT NULL,
    context JSONB,
    timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_light_actions_instance_entity ON light_actions(instance_id, entity_id, timestamp DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_light_actions_area ON light_actions(area, timestamp DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_light_actions_activity ON light_actions(activity, timestamp DESC);
```

**Note:** The `activity` field stores one of: `empty`, `movement`, or `occupied`. The `activity_duration` field stores the duration in seconds of the current activity level.

#### `automation_rules` table (for future AI rules)

```sql
CREATE TABLE automation_rules (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    instance_id UUID REFERENCES ha_instances(id),
    rule_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    conditions JSONB NOT NULL,
    actions JSONB NOT NULL,
    priority INT DEFAULT 0,
    enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Note:** Use the complete `scripts/../../scripts/supabase_setup.sql` file in the repository for the full schema with all indexes and constraints.

### Setup in Home Assistant

1. Go to **Configuration** → **Integrations**
2. Click **"+ Add Integration"**
3. Search for **"Linus Brain"**
4. Enter your Supabase credentials:
   - **Supabase URL**: Your project URL (e.g., `https://abcdefgh.supabase.co`)
   - **Supabase API Key**: Your `anon` or `service_role` key (see below)
5. Click **Submit**

The integration will validate the connection and create diagnostic sensors.

#### 🔑 API Key Selection

You can use either Supabase API key type:

**`anon` key (Recommended for Development):**
- ✅ Has built-in rate limits for safety
- ✅ Safer if accidentally exposed
- ✅ Sufficient permissions for this integration
- 📍 Found in: Supabase Dashboard → Settings → API → "anon public"

**`service_role` key (Recommended for Production):**
- ✅ Full database access
- ✅ No rate limits, better performance
- ⚠️ **Critical:** Must be kept secret (never expose client-side)
- ⚠️ Bypass all RLS policies - secure your network
- 📍 Found in: Supabase Dashboard → Settings → API → "service_role"

💡 **Quick Start:** Use the `anon` key to get started, switch to `service_role` later if needed.

#### 🔒 Row-Level Security (RLS)

If you encounter "new row violates row-level security policy" errors:

1. The integration includes RLS policies that work with both `anon` and `service_role` keys
2. If you set up your database before this version, run the `fix_rls_policies.sql` migration script
3. The script is located in the repository root and contains instructions

---

## 📱 Entities Created

After setup, you'll see these diagnostic entities:

### Sensors

- `sensor.linus_brain_last_sync`: Last successful sync with Supabase
- `sensor.linus_brain_monitored_rooms`: Number of rooms being monitored
- `sensor.linus_brain_errors`: Error count and success rate

### Buttons

- `button.linus_brain_sync_now`: Manually trigger immediate cloud synchronization

---

## 🔧 Monitored Entity Types

Linus Brain automatically discovers and monitors:

| Domain          | Device Class  | Purpose                            |
|-----------------|---------------|------------------------------------|
| `binary_sensor` | `motion`      | Detect movement                    |
| `binary_sensor` | `movement`    | Detect human movement              |
| `binary_sensor` | `occupancy`   | Detect room occupancy              |
| `sensor`        | `illuminance` | Light level measurement            |
| `media_player`  | *(any)*       | Detect media activity              |
| `light`         | *(any)*       | Learn manual control patterns      |

**Note**: Entities must be assigned to a room (area) in Home Assistant to be monitored.

### Activity-Based Light Learning Details

The light learning feature captures all manual light adjustments with activity context to understand user preferences:

- **Captured Actions:**
  - Turn on/off events
  - Brightness adjustments (0-255)
  - Color temperature changes (Kelvin or mired)
  - RGB color changes
  - HS (hue/saturation) color changes

- **Activity Context:**
  - Activity level at time of action (`empty`, `movement`, `occupied`)
  - Activity duration in seconds (how long the current activity has been ongoing)
  - Presence detection status (boolean)

- **Environmental Context:**
  - Illuminance level from sensors
  - Sun elevation (above/below horizon)
  - Time of day (hour 0-23)
  - Day of week (0=Monday, 6=Sunday)

- **Manual Detection:**
  - Only actions initiated by a user (not automations/scripts)
  - Requires `user_id` in Home Assistant event context
  - Automatically filters automated changes

- **Smart Switch Creation:**
  - Switches only created for areas with BOTH a light entity AND a movement sensor
  - Ensures automation switches are only available where activity tracking is possible
