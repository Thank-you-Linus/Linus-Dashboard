# 📬 Notification System Improvements

## Summary of Changes

All notification issues have been resolved and the system has been improved for better user experience.

---

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### 1. Discord Role Issue
**Problem**: The role appeared as "@rôle inconnu" (unknown role)
**Solution**: Changed from Discord role ID `<@&1420724757791379576>` to role name `@Beta Tester 🔍` in `.github/templates/discord-prerelease.md`

### 2. Escaped Newlines (`\n`)
**Problem**: Literal `\n` characters appeared in Discord messages instead of actual line breaks
**Solution**: 
- Replaced all `\n` string literals with real newlines in `scripts/notify-discord.sh`
- Updated all sections: CHANGELOG_EN, CHANGELOG_FR, TESTING_NOTES_EN, TESTING_NOTES_FR

### 3. Content Mismatch
**Problem**: Discord notification didn't match the release notes content
**Solution**:
- Modified extraction to use only **bold items** (`grep -E '^[[:space:]]*-[[:space:]]*\*\*'`) for main features
- Fixed sed patterns from `/###/` to `/^### /` to correctly capture sections
- Changed `grep '^-'` to `grep -E '^[[:space:]]*-'` using `[[:space:]]` for better compatibility

### 4. Release Notes Too Long
**Problem**: GitHub release notes were very long with both languages fully expanded
**Solution**: 
- Created new script `scripts/format-release-notes.sh` that formats release notes with collapsible sections
- Main features are visible immediately
- Detailed descriptions hidden in `<details>` tags
- French version in collapsible sections for improvements
- Technical details collapsed by default

   ```bash
   npm run release:format
   cat RELEASE_NOTES.md
   ```

3. **Test Discord message locally** (requires webhook):
